Voyager C# Quickstart
========================

This project provides samples using Voyager with C#


Voyager compiles against DotNet 3.5+


To register your custom extractor with Voyager, simply drop the final .dll in:
```
${app.dir}/arch/win32_x86/ext
```

To associate this extractor with a mime-type, see: [Mime To Extractor Mapping](https://github.com/voyagersearch/quickstart-java/blob/master/docs/extractors.md#mime-to-extractor-mapping)
